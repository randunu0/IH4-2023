As the nationâ€™s largest wind power producer, ERCOT operates a total installed capacity of 25 GW wind generation capacity. Additionally, ERCOT runs the electricity wholesale bulk-power and retail markets. Over 1800 active market participants generate, move, buy, sell, or use wholesale electricity.
